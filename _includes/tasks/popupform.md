#### Improve UI of the home page


-  **Description:**

Currently the homepage of the app contains a search and a scholar-registration form.
You should add a link on the homepage that points to the same registration form in a pop-up, It should be easy for users to understand what to fill in those form-feilds. 
Also, edit the search bar- make it wider and position it in the middle of the page. The homepage should look simple.
    
You can see the homepage of the currently deployed raw app [here](http://13.232.12.252/metrics/)

Code can be checked out [here](https://gitlab.com/aossie/aossie-scholar/tree/GSoC_2019)
