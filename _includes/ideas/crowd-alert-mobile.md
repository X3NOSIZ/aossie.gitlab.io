## CrowdAlert-Mobile

### Idea: React Native Mobile App

#### Description

A crowdsourced cross platform mobile application using React Native for reporting and viewing incidents around the globe. This would help those affected with it and would also provide them with timely response.

In 2018, we had two GSoC students who worked on this mobile application. Check [this](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CrowdAlert-Mobile/blob/master/doc/GSoC/2018/Vibhav_Agarwal.md) and [this](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CrowdAlert-Mobile/blob/master/doc/GSoC/2018/RishabhMaheshwaryGsoc.md) to know about Goals achieved by them, Challenges and Future scope of the project.

This mobile app still needs further improvements and new features. There is an [ongoing repository](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CrowdAlert-Mobile) which holds the code and issues on how to achieve this goal. Please consider the challenges and possible solutions discussed there when preparing your proposal. We are looking for people who could improve the iOS part of the project also apart from the android one. We are also looking for someone with a knowledge of some real time fast backend API system(maybe with NodeJS).

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- excellent knowledge of React Native and iOS also separately.

- experience with some backend technology like NodeJS.

- hands-on experience in writing testing cases using Jest.
