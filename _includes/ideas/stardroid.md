### Idea: Building Google Sky Maps from scratch on android platform

#### Description

The Google [Sky Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid) app was open-sourced back in 2012. It is an amazing project but it looks like the original developers don't have time to maintain this app actively anymore.

The iOS version of this app was developed last year. Now, we are looking to develop android version of the same app.  You are welcome to come up with your own creative ideas about how can the project be transformed into something more modular so that it can compete with others in the market. 

You can check out the current android repository of the project over [here](https://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid).

You can check out the current iOS repository of the project over [here](https://gitlab.com/aossie/starcross).

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student who has:

- knowledge and experience of building Mobile apps on native Android and iOS and/or cross-platform frameworks such as react-native.

- some astronomical and engineering temperament could be beneficial to understand the app's working and invoke enough interest to implement new features or better yet, improve existing ones.

- some experience of working with mobile sensors (accelerometers, compass and gyroscopes) and rendering views on OpenGL ES. Having these skills is an asset but not essential.
