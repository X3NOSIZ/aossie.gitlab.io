## Carbon Footprint

### Idea: Cruise Emission Calculation and Improving DevOps

#### Description

This task focuses on improving DevOps for Carbon Footprint Web Extension along with 
adding new features so that new users can benefit from the extension : 

- Integrating Web Extension tests (E2E testing) : Currently only core functions
 are tested using unit testing, students are supposed to use puppeteer for testing the whole extension. In this way, the whole extension will be tested before 
deploying/commiting helping us to keep the extension more stable. Student will have to write tests for all the websites currently supported by extension along with tests for the websites which will be added during GSoC project.

- Extension support for cruise: Currently, the extension only supports
 the calculation of carbon emission from airplane, train and cars. Students
 are supposed to integrate cruise calculation to the extension too.
 This would help more people who use extension to calculate the carbon emission. Calculation of carbon emission of cruise is significantly different when compared to aircrafts, cars and trains. In your proposal clearly explain your approach and give links to relevant documents.


Additional improvements to extension/codebase can also be proposed and will serve as an important criterion for selection.

**Note - You are supposed to propose the datasets in your GSoC proposal**

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- motivation to search, find and understand sources of reliable scientific data about CO2 emissions.
- Knowledge of unit testing, integration testing and End to End testing and experience with puppeteer.
- knowledge of OOP, Javascript, HTML/CSS and possibly some Machine Learning.
