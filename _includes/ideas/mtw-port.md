## Mind The Word

### Idea: Porting the Mind The Word extension on different platforms.

#### Description

This task focuses on porting the extension on different platforms for more users : 
1. Porting to Safari/Firefox : Currently, extension works only for Chrome, which accounts for 62% of the user. Thus, the extension is missing out on many potential users. This task would involve the student to port the extension to other browsers, including Firefox and Safari. 
2. Mind The Word would make a great Desktop App. This task involves developing a **fully-functioning** Desktop App for Mind The Word.

**Candidates are expected to follow a sane code and file structure, similar to that of the extension.** 
**The candidates are required to show at-least semi-functional prototypes in their proposal for this task.**

#### Requirements

 - Knowledge of Mind The Word's workflow (critical)
 - Various API's and methods of different browser extensions
 - Experience in developing Desktop Apps.

#### Outcome
Fully-functional browser extensions and Desktop Apps for Mind The Word.

#### Mentors
