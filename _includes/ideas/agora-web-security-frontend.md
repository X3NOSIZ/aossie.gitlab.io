## Agora Web

### Idea: Implement Security Policies and Rebuild Frontend

#### Description

This task involves improving the security and privacy of  Agora web users and finally rebuilding the frontent.

1. Security improvement: Currently Agora web reveals some rather personal information about users (voters and election admins) to users. This task will consist of improving on the privacy issue and also put an accent on security issue regarding user accounts. For this there is a need of creating a security mechanism to protect Agora web users account. This new security mechanism will be based on two factor authentication (multi factor authentication). This two factor authentication together with the normal authentication can be implemented as a micro service or as a module.

2. Rebuild Frontend: The current frontend design of the Agora web is slow and doesn't have the best design out there. There is a need to provide something more attractive and that provides a better user experience. This new design should use a modular approach, should implement lazy loading and also include angular universal for SEO.

#### Deliverables
1. a) Implement all privacy concerns as described in this document  https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/sec_priv.html

1. b) Users should be able to add two factor authentication as another security step for login. The system should be able to recognized and track the different devices through which the user has been able to signin with.

2. Rebuild the frontend using angular.
