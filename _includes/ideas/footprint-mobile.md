## Carbon Footprint

### Idea: Mobile App

#### Description

Carbon Footprint is currently a browser extension (for Chrome, Firefox and Safari) that calculates and displays the CO2 emissions incurred when driving (or using public transportation) on routes suggested by map services such as Google Maps, Here and Open Street Map. 

In 2018, we had GSoC Students who improved the overall UI, fixed major bugs and upgraded some important packages. The beta version of the mobile app is available on the Google [PlayStore ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carbonfootprint[](url))and the final release is expected soon.

There is an [ongoing repository](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint-Mobile/) which holds the code and the various issues being faced in the release. The new features we are expecting this year:

**1. Showing heat on the map**: Like the Google maps show the routes and the respective
traffic, a similar feature can be added in the app that would help identify the locations of
high CO2 emissions and savings.

**2. Releasing the IOS app and modifying the UI**: Currently we have just released the beta
version for the android build and the bugs are being fixed. This time the main focus will
be on the proper release and the IOS build.

**3. Leaderboards**: Since the app already has a friend section to connect with the friends
within the app, a leaderboard can be added there to identify the users with the most CO2
savings, this may be helpful in generating interest for the users towards the app.

#### Requirements

For this project, we are looking for a student with:

- excellent knowledge of React Native.

- experience implementing mobile apps.
