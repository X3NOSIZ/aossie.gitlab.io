## Mind The Word

### Idea: Improving the current Mind The Word extension.

#### Description

Mind The Word has gone a lot of changes in the previous years and we hope to continue the trend. This task involves improving the current extension, including :

1. **Better Quizzing Feature :** The Quizzing feature can be improved by adding new games. A simple example that has not been implemented is allowing the user to guess the word's meaning from its pronunciation.  
Also adding gaming elements, like streaks or points, would keep the learning process interesting  
  
2. **Unit Testing for robust development :** If implemented properly, this feature would test the extension on specified web-pages for checking the code quality. In simpler terms, after every commit the developer can check whether the new code is translating the right amount of words in the specified time or not.  
This would be greatly beneficial for both developers and maintainers.  
  
3. **Improved UI/UX feature :** The extension in many ways still feels unrefined. The UX of the extension has been designed keeping the developer in mind and not the user.  
A number of things can be done to improve this including and not limited to personalized statistics to the user, a Momentum-like New Page for increased user interaction and a beautiful User Interface.

**Apart from this, the candidate is expected to propose improvements/feature of his/her own. This is a critically important criterion for selection.**

#### Requirements

 - Good knowledge about Javascript. 
 - Basic idea of Web-Design and Dev-Ops. 
 - The workflow of Mind The Word extension (critical).

#### Outcome
 An improved version of the current extension.
